# slowpokebot
###### A cog written in Python for [Red-DiscordBot](https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot). [Uses discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html) and the [Shivtr API](http://shivtr.com/help/articles/34-getting-started)

Developed to automate guild management processes.

## Current working functions the bot has:
- Tracks node war participation
- Tracks guild mission participation
- Makes announcements/notifications/reminders of events (integrated with Shivtr API)
- Maintains a Sqlite database with a table for members: guild member's family name, discord nick, discord username, nw and gmission participation, and a table for the calendar
- Group system: allows members to create, view and join groups (to replace the current way the LFG channel works)
